# Formal analogy in Java
This is a formal analogy engine able to perform **verification** and **solving** operations on sequences of any type.

This code is a rewriting of [ilar](https://github.com/vletard/analogy-lua), taking advantage of Java types and structures to get a clearer, better maintainable project.

Note that work is still in progress, the system still expects more features, documentation and useful primitives.
